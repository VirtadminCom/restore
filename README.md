restore
=======

The is a restore script to allow an end user to restore a VM (or disk) independent of the VM Admins.

This project should meet these requirements:
- Allow the user to connect to a vCenter server
- Show a list of all available VMs for the user
- Allow the user to select a VM to be restored
- Allow the user to select the destination to restore to
- Should be GUI driven so it can be used by non-technical users
